This project is a system for automatic lesson schedule generation.
It aims to streamline and optimize the process of creating academic timetables by automatically assigning classes, teachers, and rooms based on given constraints and preferences.

The prototype demonstrates how algorithmic scheduling and constraint-solving techniques can be applied to educational environments to save time, reduce human error, and adapt dynamically to changing conditions.

The core scheduling logic of the project is implemented in:

\src\main\java\vea\service\impl\ScheduleServiceImpl.java

This file contains the algorithms and functions responsible for generating lesson schedules, handling constraints, and resolving conflicts.

Technologies used:
- SpringBoot
- MySQL
- JPA 
- Thymyleaf
